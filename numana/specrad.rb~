<HEAD1>Spectral radius</HEAD1>
Consider the function <M>f:\rr\to\rr</M> given by <M>f(x) =
ax,</M> where <M>a\in\rr.</M> If we think of <M>x\in\rr</M> as an
arrow (from 0 to <M>x</M> along the numberline), then this
function stretches (or shrinks and/or reflects) the arrow. What is
the effect of this function on the <I>length</I> of the arrow?
The answer is simple, it gets multiplied by <M>|a|</M>, i.e.,
<D>
|ax| = |a|\cdot|x|.
</D>
We often need an analogous result for higher dimensions, i.e.,
when <M>f:\rr^n\to\rr^n</M> is of the form <M>f(\v x) = A\v x.</M>
Here <M>A</M> is an <M>n\times n</M> matrix. Unfortunately, there
is no direct analog if <M>n\geq 2,</M> because even if <M>\v
x</M> and <M>\v y</M> have the same length, i.e., <M>\|v x\| =
\|v y\|,</M> there is no guaranty that <M>\|A\v x\|</M> will equal <M>\|A\v y\|.</M>
<P/>
However, there is a partial analog: we can have an
inequality. For any given <M>A</M> there is a nonnegative
number <M>\rho</M> such that for all <M>\v x\in\rr^n</M> we have 
<D>
\|A\v x\|\leq \rho \|\v x\|.
</D>
The smallest such <M>\rho</M> is called the <B>spectral
radius</B> of <M>A.</M> It plays the role of the "absolute value"
of a matrix. 
<P/>
It is quite easy to see why such a number exists. For this we
shall employ a little fact from analysis: 
<Q>Any  continuous
function defined over a closed and bounded set in <M>\rr^n</M> must attain its maximum
somewhere.</Q>
Consider the set of all unit vectors in <M>\rr^n.</M> This is the
unit circle in <M>\rr^n.</M> It is closed and bounded. Consider
the function <M>F(\v x) = \|A\v x\|</M> on this set. It is
continuous (since <M>\v x\mapsto A\v x</M> is continuous, and so
is the <M>\|\cdots\|</M> function). So it attains maximum. Take
this maximum as <M>\rho.</M> Do you see why this <M>\rho</M> will
serve our purpose?

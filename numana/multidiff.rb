<HEAD1>Multivariate differentiation</HEAD1>
Suppose that you have a function <M>f:\rr^n\to\rr.</M> Then we
say that it is differentiable at some <M>\v a\in\rr^n</M> if 
locally at <M>\v a</M> the function may be "well approximated" by a
linear function passing through <M>(\v a, f(\v a)).</M> Such a
function has the form 
<D>
g(\v x) = f(\v a) + \v D' (\v x -\v a).
</D>
This
linear function is what we call the tangent if <M>n=1</M> and the
tangent plane if <M>n=2.</M> When this happens, <M>\v D</M> is
called the derivative of <M>f</M> at <M>\v a.</M>
